**The Box Model**

The box model is how modern web pages organize the layout of elements.

Each item in a web page can be imaged  as being in a box, and to create a web page, we simply have to rearrange the boxes and their properties (height, width, etc.); content is like that of a Word document, where things flow from the top down and have defined positions 

This allows for **greater** flexibility in creating web pages that work well on a variety of screen sizes, in that we now have a wide variety of tools to scale each of our boxes and their content relative to each other
