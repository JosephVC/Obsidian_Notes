**double vs. single quotes in scripts**

* ![[./_resources/bash_notes.resources/image.png]]
	* this script actually works now that is incorporates double quotes
* in the below output, the top output is when the script used  single quotes  while the correct output used double quotes
	* ![[./_resources/bash_notes.resources/image.1.png]]
		and yes, you need the **./** before the shell command name
