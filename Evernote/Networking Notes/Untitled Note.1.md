**Single Page Applications (SPAs)**

originally, web pages could not offer the same level of functionality that desktop applications could.  Sites often manipulated the DOM and used template HTML code, which was good enough to deliver static content (think simple web pages with text, images, and some video, all connected with links to each other) but lacked the sort of complexity that could compete with desktop applications.  The latter's capacity to maintain application state was a key functionality traditional sites lacked. 

Modern web applications can be created that maintain an internal state, composed of reusable UI components which have their own specific functions.  Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube are such applications.
