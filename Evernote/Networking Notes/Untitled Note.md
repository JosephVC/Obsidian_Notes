We can gather information on what sort of background API requests are being made using tools such as Burp, PortSwigger, or ZAP.  Browsers themselves come shipped with basic network analysis tools.  

**Search engines**

You can refine you search results using particular operators, for example **site:[mega-bank.com](http://mega-bank.com) log in**
In order to find subdomains, you'd need to further focus your search by using additional operators such as **\-inurl:<whatever you want to include in the url>**,
