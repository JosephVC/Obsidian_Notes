If I see this shit above, it means that I'm not using a Python 3+ interpreter.  Switch the **interpreter** \- in this case within VS Code, so Ctrl + Shift + P - to at least 3.6 or something.  In this case, I used  **poetry shell**  to create a modern Python environment to run **manage.py**

**make sure you are in the right virtual environment and/or code interpreter whenever shit does not want to import**
