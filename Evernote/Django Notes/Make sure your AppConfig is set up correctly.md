Your settings in apps.py should match the name of the app in your project:

![[./_resources/Make_sure_your_AppConfig_is_set_up_correctly.resources/unknown_filename.png]]

I noticed this was a problem in one project when I tried to launch a shell in django and received a bunch of errors saying the app was not configured properly:

![[./_resources/Make_sure_your_AppConfig_is_set_up_correctly.resources/unknown_filename.1.png]]
