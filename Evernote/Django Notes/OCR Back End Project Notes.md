**OCR Back End Project Notes**

NOTE: as of 6.14.20, I got an error saying my Ghostscript installation was out of date.  Now, I used the python implementation of Ghostscript, which is only on v. 0.6, but Ghostscript itself is 9.52.  The latter might need to be added to the Aptfile 
    UPDATE: did **poetry remove OCRmyPDF, then added it again to get the latest version; 'poetry update' did not seem to do this**

**does your project name need to have dashes rather than undescores, as heroku does not allow the latter?**
