**Infosec Overview**

the infosec field has grown a shitton, including the following subfields

	Network and infrastructure security
	
	Application security
	
	Security testing
	
	Systems auditing
	
	Business continuity planning
	
	Digital forensics
	
	Incident detection and response
	

**basically, in practice, infosec is the practice of protecting data from unauthorized access, changes, unlawful use, disruption, etc**

  Much of infosec regards protecting the **CIA** of our data, or the **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Access** regarding the data

**Risk Management Process**

the risk management process involves five steps

* Identifying the Risk
	* identify the risks the business is exposed to
* Analyze the Risk
	* analyze the impact and probability of risk
	* the risks should be mapped to an organization's policies, procedures, and processes
* Evaluate the Risk
	* rank and prioritize risk
	* accept, avoid, control, or transfer risk
* Deal with the Risk
	* eliminate or contain the risk
	* handled by directly communicating with the stakeholders for the sytems
* Monitor the Risk
	* constantly monitor risks for things that could change their impact score

**Using a VPN**

* a VPN allows us to connect to a private internal network and access resources within than network as if we were directly connected to that network
* it is a secured communications channel over a shared public network
* the VPN provides a degree of privacy and security by encrypting communications over a channel
* the VPN works by routing our communications through the target VPN's private servers rather than the ISP servers
	* data will originate from the VPN's servers rather than our computers, and will have a different IP address than our own computer
* **two main types of VPNs**
	* **client based VPN**
		* requires separate client software to establish a VPN connection
		* after connecting,  user's host machine will act as if it were connected directly to company network
	* **SSL VPN**
		* uses the web browser as the VPN client
		* connection is established between the browser and the SSL VPN gateway and can be configured to only allow web apps and/or intranet sites
* **why use???**
	* VPNs can disguise one's IP address, thus allowing one to evade prying eyes

**Ports**
