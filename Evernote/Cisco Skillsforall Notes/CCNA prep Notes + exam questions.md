**Modules 9-12 Assessment**

	Which three types of nodes should be assigned static IP addresses on a network? (Choose three.)
	* Servers, Printers, Gateways
	Which message does an IPv4 host use to reply when it receives a DHCPOFFER message from a DHCP server?
	* DHCPREQUEST
* A host PC is attempting to lease an address through DHCP. What message is sent by the server to let the client know it is able to use the provided IP information?
	* DHCPACK
	Why is DHCP for IPv4 preferred for use on large networks?
	* It's a more efficient way to manage IPv4 addresses than static address assignment is
* ![[./_resources/CCNA_prep_Notes_+_exam_questions.resources/image.5.png]]
	* when a host server has been configured for dynamic IP addressing, the device tries to obtain a valid IP address.  it sends a **DHCPDISCOVER** message, which is a **broadcast message** because the address of the DHCP server is, by design, unknown.  thus the destination IP address is 255.255.255.255 and the destination MAC address is FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
	Which type of IPv6 address is not routable and used only for communication on a single subnet?
	* link-local address
	Which statement accurately describes dynamic NAT?
	* it provides automatic mapping of inside local to inside global addresses
* What is the valid most compressed format possible of the IPv6 address 2001:0DB8:0000:AB00:0000:0000:0000:1234?
	* 2001:DB8:0:AB00::1234
	What purpose does NAT64 serve in IPv6?
	* it converts IPv4 packets to IPv6 packets
	How many bits make up the single IPv6 hextet :10CD:?
	* 16
	* each portion of an IPv6 address is 16 bits
* What layer of the TCP/IP suite makes sure that all the data packets of a message arrive safely at the destination?
	* Transport
	Which type of applications are best suited to use UDP as the transport layer protocol?
	* Applications that require minimal transmission delay
	What is the purpose of using a source port number in a TCP communication?
	* to keep track of multiple conversations between devices
	* the source port number in a segment header is used to keep track of multiple conversations between devices.  it also keeps an open try for the response from the server;
	How does a client computer determine what source port number to assign to a UDP header?
	* the port number is random within the range of dynamic port numbers
	What is an advantage of UDP over TCP?
	* UDP communication requires less overhead
	What is a function of a DNS server?
	* to map a host name to a specific IP address
	What type of server would use IMAP?
	* email
