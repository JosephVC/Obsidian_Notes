		* satellite communications
* **Network types**
	* Local Area Network (LAN)
		* connects devices in a limited area 
		* home, school, small campus
		* managed by one or a few individuals
	* Wide Area Network (WAN)
		* provides access to other networks
		* managed by service providers (ISPs)
		* coverage over states, countries,e tc.
	* Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
		
		* operated by single large organizations
		
			
	* Storage Area Network (SAN)
		* meant to support file servers and data storage, retrieval, and 

* The Internet is a **global communications network**

* **Internet Connection Options**
	* **DSL**
		* **![[./_resources/Day_1_-_Network_Fundamentals.resources/unknown_filename.png]]**
		* **ADSL** is the most commonly installed version of this
		* can be delivered simultaneously on the same telephone line as telephone service
			* DSL  uses higher frequency bands for data
			* a user's computer is connected to a modem, this modem being connected to the phone lines
				* the phone line connection may be through a splitter, which splits the phone and data frequencies
				* the splitter itself is connected to a **DSLAM** on the side of the ISP and the ISP backbone
	* **Cellular Connection**
		* connection distributed over LAN areas called cells
	* **Satellite Internet**
		* a satellite dish is necessary for this sort of connection
	* **Metro Internet**
		* a way for offices of a large organization within a metro area to be connected to each other and to data centers

**Networking Trends**

* **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)**
	* personally owned devices such as laptops and phones are allowed to access privileged company applications
* **Online Collaboration**
	* people collaborating via mobile apps, VOIP calls, telepresence services
* **Cloud Computing**
	* internet-based sharing of resources and storage
	* device and location independence
	* can provide cost reduction as there are no data centers and servers to support yourselves

**Data Center**

* used to house computer systems and associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems
* redundant power supplies, cabling, etc.
* strong environmental control systems - air conditioning, fire suppression, security

**Powerline Networking**

* uses existing power cabling to transmit networking data
* electrical wiring can take the place of the need for additional networking cables
