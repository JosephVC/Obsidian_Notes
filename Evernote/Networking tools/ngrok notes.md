**Getting ngrok up and running**

When in a **poetry virtual environment**, I was able to simply type **ngrok** to get it up and running, **after** adding **pyngrok** to the poetry environment.  I don't believe this has anything to do with having downloaded ngrok, as the latter exists in an entirely different folder.
