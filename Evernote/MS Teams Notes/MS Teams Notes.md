* if you create a team, by default you are the team owner

* desktop backgrounds are only available on the desktop v. of Teams, not the web version

* when screen sharing on a Mac, if you change meeting windows to full screen it can mess with some settings, so keep the floating window
	* it's best to share one individual window rather than your whole screen
	* the window being shared will have a red border around it

* if a meeting is tied to a team channel, then it will be recorded in the Teams section, otherwise it will be in Chat
	* from the Chat section, you'll see the video and also a three-dotted menu in the upper right corner
		* this menu has options to share or link the video and also **Open in Microsoft Stream**, which will allow you watch the video in your browser

* through the Teams app you can get phone calls on your mobile

* if you're adding a tab that displays a webpage, the address needs to start with **https**

* the search bar at the top of the Teams screen is called the **command box**

	* typing the **@** symbol in the command box brings up a list of people and apps with a **message interface**
		* if you type someone's name after the @ you can then type a message to them which is immediately sent as a **private message**
		* if you type in the name of an app, you can then enter certain commands - location for a weather app, for instance - and get results in the command box
