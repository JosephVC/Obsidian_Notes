when you want to ssh into a site with a known port, username, you enter **ssh \[username\]@foo.bar.baz.org -p \[port number\]**

you might see some question about a fingerprint and whether you want to continue with connecting, but if you have good reason to consider the destination trustworthy, go ahead

you should then be prompted to type a password
