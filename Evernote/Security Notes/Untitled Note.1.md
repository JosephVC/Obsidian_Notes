**API Analysis**

You can query a website to see what methods can be used against it (PUT, POST, etc.)

* this is done with commands like **curl -i -X OPTIONS <https://www.google.com>**
* if OPTIONS works, what you get in response would be like:
* ![[./_resources/Untitled_Note.1.resources/unknown_filename.png]]

Knowing what options are available to use on a website allows us to expand the sort of tests we can put towards websites
