 ### Excellent (800-850)
 

A FICO score in this range puts you in the best possible position. You’ll qualify for the lowest interest rates, the highest credit limits, and the most favorable loan terms. Whether you’re applying for a mortgage, auto loan, or credit card, lenders will see you as a low-risk borrower. The [highest credit score](https://www.crediful.com/highest-credit-score/) you can have is 850.

### Very Good (740-799)

Borrowers in this range still receive competitive rates and approvals for most loans and credit cards. Some lenders set 750 or 760 as the cutoff for their best offers, but overall, this range keeps borrowing costs low and provides access to strong credit card rewards and loan terms.

### Good (670-739)

Most people fall into this category, and while approval chances are high, interest rates may not be the best. A 700+ score is often enough to secure a decent mortgage or auto loan rate, but improving it further can lead to better terms.

### Fair (580-669)

This range makes borrowing more expensive. Lenders see higher risk in this category, so approvals are harder to come by, and interest rates are significantly higher. Some loans, like [FHA mortgages](https://www.crediful.com/what-is-an-fha-loan/), may still be available, but expect extra fees or larger down payments.

### Poor (300-579)

Getting approved for loans or credit cards is difficult with a score in this range. If you do qualify, the interest rates will be among the highest, and you may need to provide a security deposit for credit cards or utilities. Improving your score by just 50 points could mean saving thousands of dollars over the life of a loan.
