https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/are-401k-loans-taxed.asp

- borrow against your savings rather than directly take money out
- allow you to borrow 50% of the vested amount or $10k, whatever is greater
- up to $50k total
- you have to repay this, plus interest, within 5 years
	- there are some exceptions to this
	- can repay via payroll deductions - both principal and interest
	- you repay the loan with **after tax money, meaning money you are taxed on***
	- in some cases, while you are repaying the loan, you cannot make further contributions
		- effectively paying twice
- **You don't have to pay taxes or penalties when you do a 401k loan***
- If you cannot repay the loan within the given time period, the loan can be treated as taxable income, which comes with a 10% penalty if you are under 59.5
	- one way around this is a **hardship withdrawal***
- repayment on a 401k loan does not affect your credit score
- some employers do not allow 401k loans
- you cannot do more than one loan every 12 months
