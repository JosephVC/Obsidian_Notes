- ***Hardship withdrawal***
	- emergency removal of funds
	- even if the withdrawal skirts the 10% IRS penalty, it is still subject to income tax
	- Check with the advisor/manager for the given plan
	- you will need to give evidence of hardship 
	- - Medical expenses
	- Expenses related to the purchase or repair of your principal residence
	- Postsecondary education expenses, including tuition, fees, and room and board
	- Funeral expenses
	- Paying to prevent eviction or foreclosure on your primary residence
	- limited to your actual contributions ***not the earnings on those contributions***
	- if medical expenses will be reimbursed, you can be denied a hardship expense
	- you might be ***required*** to do a 401(k) loan before a hardship loan


- ***SEPP Plan***
	- the funds you want are put in the SEPP plan
	- for five years or until you turn 59.5, whichever is later, the plan makes annual distributions
	- the 10% IRS penalty is waived but  you still pay income taxes on the distribution
	- IRS requires you to continue the SEPP plan for at least five years - the ***minimal holding period***
		- if you  cancel the plan before this five years, you pay the full 10% IRS penalty for the years that were penalty-free, plus interest for that period
	- like a hardship distribution, the funds cannot be returned to your account
	- if the 401k was with an employer, you can only enroll if you are no longer with that employer, and you can no longer make additions to that account
	- changes to the account balance other than the money put in the SEPP plan and other fees  can affect the SEPP plan itself

- ***In-Service Withdrawal***
	- regular withdrawal while you're working 
	- will owe income tax and the 10% IRS withdrawal
