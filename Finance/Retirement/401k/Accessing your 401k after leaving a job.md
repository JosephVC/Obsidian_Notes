- you can usually access a 401k after you leave a job
	- roll it in a new employer's plan, transfer to an IRA, or cash out
		- cashing out can lead to taxes and penalties

- vesting rules, processing times and other rules following the departure 

- if your 401k is frozen, you should receive notice

- while the balance you have contributed to the fund is yours, if the employer made a matching contribution, make sure those contributions have fully vested

- ***direct transfer*** - the admin of the old account can deposit the funds into your account or into the new fund
	- from one custodian to the next, and it avoids owing taxes or missing some deadline

- ***indirect rollover*** - the balance of the old account is cut in a check to you
	- you must deposit these funds in a new 401k within 60 days or else owe taxes on the entire balance in addition to the 10% penalty if  you are under 60
	- your old employer must withhold 20% of this for fed taxes

- ***direct rollover*** - transfer funds from one account to another qualified account (another 401k or Roth IRA)


- You can leave your 401(k) with your former employer if the balance exceeds $7,000.
- Rolling a 401(k) into an IRA offers more investment choices if a new employer's plan isn't available.
- Indirect rollovers involve a 60-day deadline to avoid taxes and penalties.
- Cashing out a 401(k) can lead to taxes and penalties, reducing retirement savings.
- Avoid required minimum distributions by rolling 401(k) funds to a new employer's plan
