If retirement is to permanently leave the workforce, what does that mean in a nation where doing so removes health benefits and thus the potential to survive beyond retirement? It is ultimately self-defeating. 

Retirement, in this context and for most people, is a death sentence. It is slow death by a thousand cuts that become increasingly more severe as one ages. Without an increasingly large horde of wealth to protect oneself with, to accept retirement is to accept a slow death. 

OK then, accept it. Accept death. But get back at the people who made it this way.
