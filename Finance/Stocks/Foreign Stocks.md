***Depository Receipts (DRs)***
- DR
	- financial tool used by banks to represent a foreign publicly traded security 
	- can be sponsored or unsponsored 
		- sponsored has the cooperation of the company and allows the company more rights such as voting rights vs. unsponsored 
	- an investment bank is hired to handle a country's regulations and a domestic bank is hired to act as a local custodian/broker
- ADR
	- a negotiable certificate issued by a US bank that represents a certain number of foreign shares in foreign stock to be traded on a US exchange
	- denominated in US dollars
	- security is held by a US financial institution overseas
	- an ADR should be sponsored by the underlying corporation
		- if not, it is likely to be traded Over the Counter (OTC) and be riskier as there are fewer regulations
		- OTC stocks will have a five-letter ticker symbol
	- ![[Pasted image 20251230055107.png]]
	- ADRs need to file a 20-F form every year, but OTC stocks do not (riskier)
	- JP Morgan and BNY Mellon are large guarantors or ADRs


- GDR
	- Global depository receipts 
	- shares are held by a foreign branch of an international bank
	- via these bank branches, the shares are offered globally but can be traded locally


***How to invest***
- - [**Powershares**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/powershares.asp): These exchange-traded funds offer multiple baskets of listed depositary receipts (BLDRS). One example is BLDRS Asia 50 ADR Index Fund ([ADRA](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=adra)), a capitalization-weighted ETF designed to track the performance of 50 Asian market-based DRs. It provides broad diversification to a part of the world that is expected to grow robustly. The BLDRS Developed Markets ADR Index Fund ([ADRD](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=adrd)) and the BLDRS Emerging Markets 50 ADR Index Fund ([ADRE](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=adre)) are similar.11
- You can invest directly in foreign companies that trade on U.S. exchanges like Sony Corporation ([SNE](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=sne)) and Toyota Motor Corporation ([TM](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=tm)).
- While over-the-counter (OTC) stocks like Samsung (SSNLF) offer an opportunity to invest across borders, they are not as forthcoming with their earnings reports as ADRs are.
