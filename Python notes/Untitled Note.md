**Breaking Poetry**

So, there is a way to break Poetry if the latter can't find the Python libraries it needs.  I found this out after 

* re-installing windows on  my laptop,
* re-installing Python,
* seeing a thread on how Tesseract needs a 64 bit version of Python
* downloading said version of Python
* breaking Poety, as the latter either doesn't work with 64 bit or can't otherwise find what it needs
