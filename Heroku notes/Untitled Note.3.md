**Django Aptfile notes**

the Aptfile is needed for extra programs/shit you can't necessarily push with the rest of the Django project
so, if you need a giant program like tesseract, which isn't necessarily a python module can install and push along with everything else, you'll need to specify it within the Aptfile
