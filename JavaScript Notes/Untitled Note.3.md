**Classes**

classes describe the shape of an object and what properties and methods it has; basically what the object does

the way JS creates objects is called **prototype-based,** which is unusual

We can also use what are called constructors, which define special methods that initialize the object

the bottom example is a constructor that allows for more flexibility when assigning names; now we can create as many names as we want rather than have to define them all in the class itself

After I create a class Cat, I can create a new instance of that class by using the keyword **new**; in order to instantiate a method, we need to use this keyword

the special name for functions created in your classes is  **methods**

You **cannot**  call an instance method directly
