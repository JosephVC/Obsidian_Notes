• What are the key components of a power supply unit, and why is it important to ensure the  
PSU is compatible with the system case and motherboard?  
• How do you calculate the total power requirements of a PC, and why is PSU efficiency  
important?  
• What is a modular power supply, and how does it improve airflow and cooling within the  
chassis?  
• What is the purpose of a heat sink and thermal paste, and how do they work together to cool  
the CPU?  
• What are the components of an open-loop liquid cooling system, and what maintenance is  
required to keep it functioning properly?


- insufficient power can lead to crashing and shutdowns and/or damage components as the PSU is constantly pushed to capacity

• 80 PLUS Bronze: At least 82% efficiency at 20% load, 85% at 50% load, and 82% at 100%  
load.  
• 80 PLUS Silver: At least 85% efficiency at 20% load, 88% at 50% load, and 85% at 100%  
load.  
• 80 PLUS Gold: At least 87% efficiency at 20% load, 90% at 50% load, and 87% at 100%  
load.

- PS1 port: the is the motherboard's main connector; a 24 pin ATX power connector

- water cooling
	- water loop/tubing and pump: coolant is added via the reservoir and pushed through the system
	- water blocks and brackets: attaches to each device and uses convection to move heat; attaches to the water loop
	- AIO (all in one): available for single components, usually the CPU or GPU
