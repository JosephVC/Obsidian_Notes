Basic Diagnostic Steps
1. Eliminate Software Issues: Ensure that software, disk/file corruption, and malware are not  
the causes.  
2. Identify Patterns: Determine if the problem is truly intermittent or follows a pattern. For  
example, if errors occur after the PC has been running for a while, it could indicate a thermal  
issue.  
3. Check Power Supply: Verify that the power supply is providing stable voltages to the system.
4. Suspect Hardware: If the power supply is not the issue, consider problems with memory,  
CPU, or the motherboard. Use diagnostic test programs provided by the vendor, which are  
often run from the firmware setup utility rather than the OS.  
5. Observe Physical Symptoms: If no diagnostic utilities are available, look for physical  
symptoms to identify issues with the motherboard, RAM, or CPU.


- blanking plates cover holes in the PC
	- random holes can disrupt airflow and interfere with cooling

- older computers stored system settings in CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) RAM
	- modern computers use NRAM (non-volatile random-access memory) or flash memory for config data, so the battery mainly supports the RTC (Real Time Clock)
	- modern computers may not even have an RTC but use NTP (Network Time Protocol) to sync with network clocks
