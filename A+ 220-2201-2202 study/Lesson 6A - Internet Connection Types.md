**Internet Connection Types and Modems**
- the Internet backbone is high bandwidth fiber optic links connected by **Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)**
- Internet Service Providers establish high speed links between networks
- a consumer connecting to an ISP uses the nearest **point of presence (POP)**
- an **Internet connection type** is what is used to link a local network to a residence or small office to an ISP's PoP - often point to point
	- this sort of connection to a WAN interface is usually done via modem rather than ethernet switches and routers

	- the modem establishes a physical connection to a WAN interface
	- routers and the Internet Protocol allowed you to interconnect networks, as these allow the identification of each network and the forwarding of data between them

**Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) Modems**
- **publicly switched telephone network (PSTN)** - plain old telephone system - POTS
- uses higher frequencies than are used on the above telephone lines
	- use of advanced modulation and echo cancelling techniques
- **asymetrical DSL** - fast downlink but slow uplink 
	- download rates of 24Mbps and upload of 1.4Mbps/3.3Mbps
- symmetric versions of DSL offer the same upload/download
- **fiber to the X** - project to upgrade fiber to a given premises from the curb
- **fiber to the curb (FTTC)** - retain some copper wiring in the premises while also extending the fiber link from the point of Prescence to a cabinet serving multiple subscribers
	- often uses **very high speed DSL (VDSL)**
	- DSL modems are not interchangeable - an ADSL modem is unlikely to support VDSL but a VDSL modem will likely support ADSL

**Fiber to the Premises and Optical Network Terminals**
- **fiber to the premises (FTTP)** - a service provider's
