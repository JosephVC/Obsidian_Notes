• What are the steps to install the CPU into the socket, apply thermal paste, and attach the  
heat sink and fan to manage heat?  
• What is the process for installing RAM modules into the color-coded DIMM slots, ensuring  
they are properly seated and secured?  
• How do you use SATA ports on the motherboard to connect SSDs or HDDs for persistent  
storage?  
• What is the process for installing NICs into available PCIe slots to provide network  
connectivity?  
• How do you choose ATX motherboards for full-size cases with up to seven expansion slots?  
• How do you identify the correct headers for the power button, HDD activity lights, audio  
ports, and USB ports?


- RAM is non persistent 

- motherboard chipset: manages data transfer between the CPU and other chipset devices; this chipset is soldered onto the motherboard and can't be  upgraded. motherboard chipset determines what processors are compatible with the system, what and how much RAM the system supports, and other hardware capabilities. what the motherboard chipset does not support, you get expansion cards for

- DIMM: dual in-line memory module; with more channels the memory can simultaneously access multiple DIMMs at once

- a card can fit into any port with an equal  or greater number of lanes, known as up-plugging (e.g., an x8 card in an x8 or x16 slot)

- PCIe can provide up to 75w of power
- if lanes for the PCIe are shared with other components, each component may not operate at full speed

**Motherboard form factors**
- Advanced Technology Extended (ATX) - 12x9.6 inches - up to seven expansion slots
	- micro-ATX - 9.6x9.6
- Information Technology Extended (ITX) - for home use and mini
