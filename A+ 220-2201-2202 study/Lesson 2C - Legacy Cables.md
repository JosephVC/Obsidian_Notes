• What type of adapter is needed to connect new computers to DVI monitors, and how do you  
ensure all connections are secure?  
	- you would need an HDMI or DP to DVI adapter, making sure the DP is secure in the converter and/or making sure the screws for the cables, if applicable, are tight
• How do you install a SCSI Host Bus Adapter (HBA) into an available PCIe slot on a new  
workstation?  
• What is the process for accessing and transferring data from the IDE hard drives to the new  
systems?  
• How do you connect an RS-232 serial cable to the console port on network equipment?  
	- there should be a supplied RS232 cable to connect to the networking gear; it should connect to

each workstation, allowing multiple devices to connect simultaneously?


- DVI and VGA only support video, and do not simultaneously transmit audio

- VGA supports up to 1920x1080 - is a 16 pin connector but most installs use a 9 pin DB9 interface
- a serial port transmits data one bit at a time over a single wire
	- the  serial data is formatted using start, stop, and parity bits
		- known as RS-232
	- data rates up to 115kbps
- Windows labels the serial port as the COM port

- active adapters: user circuitry to convert signals (digital to analog)
- passive adapters: do not change the signal and just go between connector types; both connectors need to  use the same signaling standard 

- common types of cable adapters
	- video adapters: convert between signaling types, like HDMI to VGA, etc
	- usb adapters: convert between  usb connector types, like USB-A to USB-C
	- USB hubs: use one usb cable to a hub that allows multiple devices to connect
	- USB adapters: USB to HDMI or USB-C to Lighting
