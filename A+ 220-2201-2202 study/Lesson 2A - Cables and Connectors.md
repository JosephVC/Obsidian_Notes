• How would you upgrade the internal components of the older PCs?  
• What video adapters (e.g., HDMI to DisplayPort) are appropriate for connecting monitors to  
PCs?  
	- in general it would be DisplayPort, as the PC is stationary and the display cable does not need to be disconnected and reconnected routinely. this can be difficult with the nature of traditional DP cables
• When is it necessary to use powered USB hubs to support multiple devices?  
• How can USB hubs be used to expand the number of available USB ports on each  
workstation?  
• How do you mount a 4K display in the conference room and connect it to the power source?  
• What steps should be taken to ensure all connections are secure and to test each input  
source for proper video and audio transmission?  
• What are the steps to use Lightning to USB adapters to connect iPhones and iPads to PCs  
for data transfer and charging?

**Types of USB 2.0 connectors**

• Type A: Flat rectangular connector for host and some peripheral devices, inserted with the  
USB symbol facing up.  
	- ![[Pasted image 20250921162213.png]]
• Type B: Square connector with a beveled top for large devices like printers.  
- ![[Pasted image 20250921162235.png]]
- type b connectors that are USB 2 cannot be used with a USB 3 type B port
• Type B Mini: Smaller connector for smaller peripheral devices like early digital cameras, but  
now rarely used.

• Type B Micro: Flatter connector for smaller devices like smartphones and tablets.

**USB Cable Length**
- Lowspeed devices: max cable length is 3 meters
- HighSpeed and HighSpeed devices: max cable length is 5 meters
- SuperSpeed: approx. 3 meters but there is no official max

**Power delivery**
- Basic USB ports can provide up to 4.5 watts
- PowerDeliver ports can supply up to 100 watts depending on the cable used

**Monitor Types**
- In Plane Switching (IPS) LCD
	- good color accuracy and viewing angles. very good for graphic design pro use
	- slower response time compared to TN displays, so not suited for xtreme gaming
- Twisted Nematic (TB) LCD
	- fast response times and refresh rates
	- poor color reproduction and viewing angles
- Vertical Alignment (VA) LCD
	- better color accuracy and viewing angles than TN
	- slower response times than TN but better than IPS. at extreme angles there is color shifting
- Organic Light-emiting diode (OLED)
	- offers excellent color accuracy, contrast ratios, energy efficiency, and black reproduction (because the pixels are their own light source)
	- issues with burn in, where a static image can leave a permanent mark if displayed for a long period
- Mini-Led Technology
	- Mini-LED technology offers improved brightness, better contrast and brightness and black levels, color accuracy, and the reduction of a  halo affect (like a mouse pointer having a halo around it)
	- expensive, and eat more power than OLEDs, do  not achieve the true black of OLEDs

Inverters are for older LCDs and needed to convert DC power into AC for the sake of the backlighting. LED backlights do not usually require an inverter

thunderbolt devices won't work in non thunderbolt USB-C ports

**SATA connectors**

![[Pasted image 20250921171414.png]]

- no power is supplied via the 7 pin connector but rather through a 15 min connector
- SATA 3 has speeds up 600 Mbps
- ![[Pasted image 20250921171649.png]]
- Molex connectors use insulation color codes to indicate volage levels
	- red = 5 volt for volt direct current (VDC)
	- yellow = 12 VDC
	- black = ground
	- DC current refers to the unidirectional flow of charge, which is essential for other electronics to function
