- A system administrator is recovering a system from backups, and has a total of four backup sets for the restoration. Which of the following backup types is most likely in use?
	- ==Incremental==
		- a full backup is taken first
		- subsequent backups contain data changed since the last full backup and the last incremental backup
			- you are less likely to be copying over the same shit you just backed up and can manage changes in data better
		- usually smaller than full backups
		- a restoration requires the full backup and all of the incremental backups
