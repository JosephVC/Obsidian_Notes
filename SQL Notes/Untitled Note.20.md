**DELETE**

Just as you can ADD or SELECT data, you can DELETE it

just like ADD, DELETE will wipe everything unless you specify where a thing must be deleted

![[./_resources/Untitled_Note.20.resources/sql - DELETE.png]]

this is where the WHERE keyword comes into play, to select which parts of the database to delete

![[./_resources/Untitled_Note.20.resources/sql - DELETE using WHERE.png]]
