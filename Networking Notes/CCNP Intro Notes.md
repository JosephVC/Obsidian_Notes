The purpose of the exam

Previously you needed to have the CCNA before the CCNP, but no longer; you can jump into any Cisco cert other than the CCIE lab (which has one prereq.)

**Software tools**

* Python for automation
* Ansible
* general code scripting
* SD-WAN
* ICE
* Cisco DNA

**You need to take two exams to be CCNP certified, regardless of what track you go down.**  

**6 Tracks to the CCNP**

* Enterprise
	* Advanced Routing
	* SD-WAN
	* Wireless
	* Automation
	* \-
	* \-
		* CCIE Enterprise Covers all the above
* Service Provider
* Data Center
* Security
* Collaboration
* Cisco Certified DevNet Professional

Within each track has its own specific technology core and there is one exam based on this core; after passing this core one picks a particular concentration within that track which leads to the CCNP cert (you can decide what type of CCNP you want to be).  there is nothing 'special' you get if you somehow complete every sub-specialty. 

**Each concentration exam is it's own cert.**

* this means you have more freedom to jump around to other 

Regardless of track, there will be some automation

**Technology Core - 300-401 ENCORE**

* 15% of the exam deals with automation

How big is the jump from CCNA to CCNP?  

* there are gaps, which you would need to self study to overcome
