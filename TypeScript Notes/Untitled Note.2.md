**Literal Types**

There are some types that can only mean one thing, such as the number  **1**

the number is what it is and cannot be converted any way to anything else, thus the term **literal types**

If we want things to be more flexible, we can use unions of types with the pipe operator |

while other languages may not support this literal typing, the latter can be useful for when running sorts

while booleans are also literal types, the above style allow for more descriptive variable names

Like the example of the number one, because booleans are also literal types you can't just assign them to other variables
