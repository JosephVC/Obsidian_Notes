**Generic Arrays**

You can use angle brackets - < > - when making arrays rather than just using the square brackets  

All the same rules regarding type apply

The **Array** we created above is like an empty cup of a certain **type;** we can only fill that cup with coffee of a certain type

![[./_resources/Untitled_Note.3.resources/typescript - generic arrays - booleans.jpg]]

in the above, create a cup that can only accept boolean coffee, and here we want to see the 0th element of that array, which is true; the 1st element of the array would be false

we can also create arrays of arrays, so when pulling an element out of the main array, gives us another array
