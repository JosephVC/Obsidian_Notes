**Functions as Arguments**

JS functions can be assigned to variables
In addition to this, JS functions are considered "first class" as they have no restrictions on their use; by extension Typescript also has first-class functions

we can also put a function within an array

The use of parentheses when using functions this way is important, as it changes the meaning of the code and can lead to type errors

If this isn't cool enough, we can pass functions to other functions
