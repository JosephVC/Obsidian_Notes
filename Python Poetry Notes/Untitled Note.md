**General Poetry Notes**

When seeing the following errors re installing or uninstalling Poetry

![[./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/unknown_filename.png]]

Note, this is after installing the Python 3.7 64-bit version, which poetry may not have seen???

a **pip install -user poetry** seems to have done the trick, although some packages don't seem to be found and need to be re-added
