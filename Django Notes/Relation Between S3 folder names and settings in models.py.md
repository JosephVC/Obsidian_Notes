When creating an app to upload to S3, what you set the FileField to **upload\_to** is what that folder will be called in S3:
![[./_resources/Relation_Between_S3_folder_names_and_settings_in_models.py.resources/unknown_filename.png]]

![[./_resources/Relation_Between_S3_folder_names_and_settings_in_models.py.resources/AWS - S3 folder names related to Django models.png]]
