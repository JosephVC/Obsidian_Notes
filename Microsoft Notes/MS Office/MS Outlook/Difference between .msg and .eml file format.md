| MSG files are supported in all versions of MS Outlook but they can’t be opened, created, or saved in other email clients.                                                                                                         | EML files are used to store individual messages and can be accessed with the help of most email applications.                                                       |
| They are specifically designed for Outlook versions and hence, can be opened in any Windows operating system.                                                                                                                     | They are universally accessible, which means they can be opened in different operating systems and devices.                                                         |
| It doesn’t take much storage space, however, if the emails have attachments then it will take a significant amount of storage.                                                                                                    | A similar case is with EML files, the size of the file depends upon the attachments and other data in a particular email message.                                   |
| the files contain additional information, such as the message subject, sender’s name, etc. Such information makes it easier to find emails. <br><br>The format also supports voting buttons, custom fields, and more in Outlook.  | **EML** files contain most of the message data, including attachments, but, for example, some internal Outlook properties and fields cannot be saved in EML format. |
| **MSG** files contain all fields and internal properties of messages and other Outlook mailbox items. Emails in MSG format contain unique Outlook fields that can be displayed in Windows Explorer and searched by their contents |                                                                                                                                                                     |

A .msg file isn’t just a simple text document; it’s a structured file containing various components, all neatly packaged together. Think of it like a digital jigsaw puzzle. Let’s break down the key pieces:

- **Email Header:** This contains essential information about the email, like the sender’s email address, the recipient’s email address(es), the subject line, and the date and time the email was sent.
- **Email Body:** This is the actual content of the email message. It can be plain text or formatted text, including images, hyperlinks, and other rich text elements.
- **Attachments:** Any files attached to the email are stored within the .msg file. This could include documents, spreadsheets, images, PDFs, or any other type of file.
- **Metadata:** This is data _about_ the data. It includes things like timestamps (when the email was sent, received, opened), read receipts (if enabled), and other information about the email’s properties.
- **MAPI Properties:** .msg files use the Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) to store information in a structured way. This allows Outlook and other compatible programs to easily access and interpret the data.
